# Tailwind CSS in DOMStack

This example demonstrates how to integrate Tailwind CSS with DOMStack, providing a powerful utility-first CSS framework for your websites and applications.

## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs without leaving your HTML. Instead of pre-designed components, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs.

## How This Example Works

This example shows how to:

1. Configure ESBuild to process Tailwind CSS
2. Import Tailwind into your global CSS
3. Use Tailwind classes in Preact components
4. Create responsive, utility-based designs

## Key Files

- `globals/esbuild.settings.js` - Configures the Tailwind plugin
- `globals/global.css` - Imports the Tailwind framework
- `isomorphic/client.js` - Demonstrates Tailwind classes in components

## Example Component

The example includes a Todo application with Tailwind styling for:
- Responsive layouts
- Spacing utilities
- Flexbox components
- Colors and shadows
- Interactive states (hover effects)
