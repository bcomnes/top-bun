This is an example site showing how to use DomStack as a Fastify plugin.

The site is automatically built when the Fastify server starts, and pages can be served directly from Fastify routes.

## Features

- Static site generation with DomStack
- Dynamic server routes with Fastify
- Automatic rebuilding when files change (in development mode)
- All the power of DomStack and Fastify combined!

Check out the [API](/api/hello) for a simple example of a Fastify route.
